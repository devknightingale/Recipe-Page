## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I utilized media queries for the first time in my CSS, and using the dev tools in Chrome allowed me to set the min-width appropriately for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I definitely want to spend more time with media queries and really get a better hang of them as well as learn what the typical queries used in professional development are. Are there a standard set of screen sizes that websites are developed for? These are things I don't quite know yet but hope to learn.
